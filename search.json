Those visualizations demonstrate that during the 0 win season, attendance gradually decreased until week 12 and saw an abrupt increase and decrease in the coming weeks. In the winning season, attendance was larger all throughout the season, but saw the same decreases during different parts. During the middle chunk of the season (weeks 3-13) there was a gradual increase that was not seen during the losing season.",
